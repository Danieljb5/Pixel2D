# Pixel2D Network
This is a small network addon for Pixel2D, using ASIO to handle network requests.

# Building Examples On Windows
Make sure you have MinGW 64 Bit installed and make a PATH variable in advanced system settings containing the path to the folder that contains g++.exe and gcc.exe .Run the buildExamples.bat script with the name of the example, e.g. buildExamples.bat example

# Building Examples On Linux
Make sure you have the latest version of SFML and g++, and run the buildExamples script - with no parameters it will build all examples, the name of a file - e.g. example.cpp can be used to build one or more example(s) and clean will remove the output folder.
